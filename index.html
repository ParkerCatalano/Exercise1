              <h2>Life Thus Far...</h2>
              <p>Since I was just a youngin, I've been drawing and making art with various mediums.  I eventually got into School of the Arts in San Francisco where, after they discontinued the guitar program I had originally intended to apply for, I subsequently studied visual art for three years.  Although my college career ended up being a Literary one, I am still as fond of visual art as I ever was, and feel that I will be able to incorporate my skills into the programming and development world in a front-end design capacity. "I turned back to the moon, thinking to myself, the moon doesn't seem to care what one thinks, that it looked like a drum, and smiled at my harmless megalomania" (Grass, GÃ¼nter p. 366). Under the assumption that the body inscribes experience and history on and within itself, the question of agency is prevalent in terms of the extent to which we govern our bodies as such. Within the group of marked bodies, a specific modality of knowledge based on witheld significancies is established which is the essential code of conduct imposed from without.  Is technology an extension of the body?

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I began working at a startup called MOG founded by David Hyman, Co-founder of the track-finding software Gracenote in 2006.  It was a summer job and I was doing mostly QA and beta testing for the site's various widgets and extensions, as well as some blog post editing.  It was technically a paid internship, and I was very fortunate to be able to experience a workplace like that at my age.  It taught me a lot of very valuable lessons about the startup world and the problems that face even a well funded website.  This is no industry for the faint-hearted.
