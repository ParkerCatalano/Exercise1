		 Social Novels in 19th Century Paris and London:
                  The Development of State Interest in Limiting Imagination

	The hidden dimensions underlying Gustav Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, Honoré de Balzac’s Lost Illusions and Charles Dickens’ Our Mutual Friend question the historical and social contexts in which nations began to invest in the restriction of imagination through institutions.  The morphic quality of their brands of Realism are highlighted not only by the use of setting as a filter for perspective, but also through the transition from hyper-descriptive language as utilized by Balzac in Lost Illusions to the anthropomorphization of London that takes place in Dickens.  Madame Bovary serves as a concrete example of the median work whose hybrid style ended up being wildly prosecuted for feminine immorality, thereby demonstrating the type of social implications literary works can have as well as pushing the envelope of imagination where and when it was most feared, particularly with regards to sexuality, social mobility and discourses on conventionality.  What is learned through novels like these can be directly applied to public reality and the dialectic relationship between collective and individual legitimacy in works of art like these helps to illuminate the ability for conventions to be mediated by the separated narrative frame.
	Honoré de Balzac seemed very concerned with the state of the writer and readership when he wrote Lost Illusions, and in his depiction of social realities he utilizes an autobiographical lens to bring out the hidden mechanisms at work in human society.  Throughout La comedia Humane, the use of Speculum Mundi as a device for this illumination of underlying truths acts twofold to also parody the epic form.  While the speculative model uses descriptions and discernment to illustrate hidden mechanisms, the encompassed imago mundi which demonstrates the cosmic order and chaos through the image of centrality and peripherality, and axis mundi which focuses on the vertical dimension of sacred imagery are essentially parodied.
	In terms of focus and technique throughout Lost Illusions, Balzac is very vehement in his use of physiology which centers on organic and mechanic models of description, and capharnaum, or the inclusion of the ruins of a old system or order.  These two devices for filtering perspective work simultaneously and in constant repetition throughout the novel to demonstrate the desire for some traditional social image despite the undeniably new and modern underlying mechanisms running France at the time.  In the excerpt I chose to analyze, Coralie is described as being quite base in intelligence despite her abilities in acting, which as the Gallery scene begins to unfold at this point, relates to the dichotomy between appearance and internal operations which runs fluidly throughout the story.
	Very often throughout Lost Illusions, Lucien is confronted with appearances as masks for their fundamental internal vices or inconsistencies.  This split between appearance and reality is fundamental to Balzac's prose and style and is one of the reasons why this novel gained so much praise in terms of social and political commentary.  With regards to Lucien's experiences in the Parisian literary world, there are a number of times when he himself notices the hidden dimension therein.  Yet he still holds back his contempt of this farcical representation for the pursuit of that idyllic image of success presented and reified throughout his social encounters.  The Gallery scene in Lost Illusions very clearly demonstrates the veiled realm of that social world, and truly frames Lucien's talent and desire within a seemingly impossibly exclusionary social sphere.  The perpetuation of this sphere is relegated primarily to the consensus that took place in the dying Parisian aristocracy about a grand illusion of convention and decorum comprising reality in their contemporary social development.  Surface and depth are also discussed in detail, and one can see in reading Lost Illusions that disillusionment is not the same as loosing a belief that was false to begin with.  Perhaps what is most ardently discussed in this novel is the demystifying quality of literary scenes like those Lucien encounters and the role of speculum mundi in bringing out the underlying mechanisms at work in society so that people aren't fooled into believing in social stratification and fixedness. One can see traces of this type of criticism in the relationship between the way Lucien interacts with and is influenced in his actions by Madame de Bargeton and conversely the poor youthful Coralie.
	As a canonical work, Lost Illusions is centered on object fixation, and with good reason, as it is through this filter of prose that one can observe the way that people were changing in terms of their techniques of competitive and synthetic judgment in Parisian society.  Journalism is used in this way to directly contrast the speculum mundi, and illustrate the way that the manipulation of the individual can directly affect the image of the whole of social relations.  Art and science in this way alternately compliment each other in the narration to bring pieces or fragments into a comprehensive whole.  This can be seen in David’s mechanical and apollonian approach to life next to Lucien’s dream oriented desires and more Romantic, Dionysian side of the social spectrum.  Realism in this way was viewed as prescriptive because it was focused on specificities in order to inhibit submerged tendencies in literature which might cause deviations from the standard in language and behavior.  Synthetic judgment in the context of this novel is the direct result of industrialization and modern forms of object creation which extended to the whole of French society.  By illustrating the affect of an object fixated perspective that Balzac repeatedly uses, he is not only demonstrating the competitive judgment of character at the individual level, but also the synthetic judgment which can only be placed in the distinct historical context in which the emergence of identification through materialism and decorum.
	The emergence of the first person format was through epistolary works, and their inclusion in Lost Illusions for the correspondences between friends and family illustrates a very essential aspect of Balzac's style and prose that characterized the mirroring affect of the Speculum Mundi.  Lucien and Charles throughout lost illusions provide a focalization that is directly correlated to the speculum mundi as well which sought to recognize and point out the existing mechanisms of society and life that are hidden from the surface or initial interpretation.
	There seems to be a definite connection between how money and economic status play into class relations and social behavior, while the state began to invest in the allocation of knowledge through technologies of power like institutions and publications.  This is perhaps as apparent in Lost Illusions as it is in Flaubert's Madame Bovary, but while Balzac represents society and the morphic character of what characters deem real through a focalized perspective, Flaubert utilizes the disjunctive sort of ambiguous narration with less description to illustrate the opaque way that people desire objects as if they were veiled by some external force like money.  His intention was to dispel the romantic "great passion" which, along with romantic ideologies in general, he saw as misleading to the readership, although his wedge form of style was the partial claim for his prolific fame.  The way in which not only the individual, but the time as well is encapsulated in the photographic realism of Flaubert can be associated with the notion that external forces are always at play in the characteristics of individuals, which moves the focus from an internal to a more social and external discourse on the then developing technologies of manipulation.  The object of desire for Mme Bovary, which would serve as the motivating force for life is never clear or certain as her emotions and reactions to situations are almost always influenced by either a figure of power or some economic concern.  When the narrator is describing Emma's view of Parisian social life it posits that, "...it's teeming, tumultuous life was divided into compartments, classified into separate tableaux.  Of these Emma was aware of only two or three, which hid all the others from her, and by themselves represented the whole of humankind" (Flaubert 53).  What this excerpt illustrates is not only the concentration on milieu as the dominant force in the development of proper traits and therefore being which Flaubert is criticizing, but also the interest in the single object representing the whole of desirable objects in society.
	Milieu forms the network and framework through which we can see Lucien’s changes as reactions to the external forces which make up the Parisian literary society in Balzac’s lost Illusions.  Balzac posits how for Lucien, "The proximity of so many pretty women of Paris, so elegantly and daintily dressed, made him notice how dowdy Mme de Bargeton's clothes were in comparison, although she had done her best" (Balzac 163). Here it is clear that comparative and synthetic judgment are at an impasse, and Balzac intended in order to call to mind the social whole as chaotic and in a constant discourse of exclusionary tactics towards ideas.  While it is through comparison that Lucien suddenly finds his desired mistress less fascinating, it seems more to be due to the setting of Paris itself which evokes the emotional change giving it a semi-anthropomorphic quality.
	In the section that I chose to explicate, Lucien is surrounded essentially by a synesthetic perception relayed to the reader through Balzac's colorful narration.  This is contrasted however by the technical layer at work in his writing which seeks to demystify the mechanisms at work underneath the surface layer of society.  "At the Theatre-Francaise you may have the influence of a prince, or a First Gentleman of the Bedchamber, but that will get you nowhere; the actors will not lift a finger unless you are in a position to damage their reputations" (Balzac 250).  Demonstrated in this quote is the hierarchical social structure which in a comparative sense leads Lucien to question the role of literature, journalism and the manipulated perspective of events and images.  The theater is an analogy for the framing of life in Paris as well since one gets the impression that a certain level of status is required to even become involved in the play, as with social life off of the stage.  When Flaubert was prosecuted and put on trial in 1857, a specific emergence of state control of imagination also took place.  Ernest Pinard was the prosecutor of Madame Bovary stating it to be in "offense to public and religious morality and to good morals", which clearly illustrates the clinical approach to reality utilized by Balzac and Flaubert.  In Madame Bovary, the instability of social and ethical relations acts as a reflection of ordinary and imagined reality echoing each other, thereby illustrating what Pinard thought were the dangers of seducing the imagination.
	Dickens picks up essentially where Flaubert and Balzac left off in terms of the depiction of actual social life as teemed with underlying and hidden systems of operation and manipulation.  While Balzac does begin to introduce a sort of clinical approach to reality, Dickens takes it a step further in his projection of London as this extreme power of economic stability and hyper-population increase yet also as a diseased body in need of some exceptional cure outside of the realm of the Vienna Consensus' restrictions.  Art in Britain was very focused on the idea that transparency was the principle theme of the nation as was exhibited in the architectural feats of Westminster Abbey and the Glass Palace of the Great Exhibition of 1851.  Lizzie is perhaps the only character in the novel who actually reflects the virtues of truth and transparency, whereas the rest of the female characters are more opaque in terms of fidelity and their surface appearance in comparison to their behavioral selves.  The book centers on the theme of rebirth and renewal which were true factors in London's development technologically and as a mega-metropolis.  The dust heaps which are constantly made reference to and are essentially the perfect signifier for the trope of decay, which is another quite repeated theme and one that is closely correlated to the notion of ephemerality and the temporality of aspects of social life in London.  The emergence of photography can be seen as a sort of tangential development from this trope of Dickens' since it was related to a growing attachment to time, and temporal organization of daily life.
	 Society is for the most part portrayed as a collection of roles rather than strictly class oriented as Balzac and even Flaubert at times tend to utilize characters and their various milieus.  There is also a heavy use of symbolism on the part of Dickens especially with the Thames and the indefinite depiction of the city as a character with bodily descriptions. In the attached section of Our Mutual Friend, one can clearly see with regards to the veneering family, the sort of cultural and iconic linkage between Paris and London which epitomizes the correlation between Dickens and Flaubert and Balzac in Paris. The narrator voices with regards to the Veneering’s traffic shares that, “To set those blaring images so high, and to cause us smaller vermin, as under the influence of henbane or opium, to cry out night and day, ‘Relieve us of our money, scatter it for us, buy us and sell us, ruin us, only we beseech ye take rank among the powers of the earth, and fatten on us” (Dickens 115).  This emphasizes the trope of decay and urban imagery through the vermin correlation as well.  All three of the aforementioned works seem to posit a discontent at the relationship between politics and culture or the arts or literature.  If language and literature can be looked at in Dickens' time as the ultimate locus of expression, it would follow then that the interpretive potential of this semi-autobiographical work is vast.
	In summation, Dickens as an isolated example of hyper-realism in terms of emphatic diction can be seen as the product of the preexisting discourse between Flaubert and Balzac who essentially utilized the methodology of prescriptive narration though with an oscillation between focalized and non-focalized perspectivism.  While Lost Illusions and Madame Bovary both point out the inconsistencies of the libidinal economy’s interpolation between the influence of cultural and economic milieus, Our Mutual Friend introduces a reflective perspective that manifests the same notions of fundamental truths about the whole being expressed through extra-textual descriptions of individual characters.  This apparent progression of style and method is linked to technological and cultural developments within 19th century France and England, but particularly in the economic centers of Paris and London where the influence of money on class distinction and social mobility are clear and persistent.
